     LOFS is a software tool for online streaming feature selection. 
     online streaming feature selection provides a new, complementary 
     algorithmic methodology to enrich online feature selection, including
     the algorithms mining features added individually over time, and the 
     ones online learning grouped features added sequentially. The tool is 
     written in MATLAB, and easy to install and implement.
